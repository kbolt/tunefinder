Here is a list of songs from tonight's episode:

Performer | Song | Scene
:----------: | :-------------: | :-----
CC Adcock & The Lafayette Marquis| Maison Creole| Sookie prepares food for Thanksgiving; Jason plays with his daughter when Bridgette tells him it's time to go; Sam arrives to Sookie's with his daughter, he's greeted by the Stackhouse family.
Junkie XL| Dampener Rod| Eric having dead Yakuza in the backseat of their own car while he is driving it.
Led Zeppelin| Thank You| Sarah's hallucination of Steve asks her what's she thankful for; Jason and the kids play as they run out to the feast; Everyone eat, drinks and chat as they eat dinner together.---
